## The main idea of Merkle trees:
Merkle Trees are a data structure used in computer science and cryptography to efficiently verify and secure data. They organize data in a tree where each leaf node is a hash of a data block, and each non-leaf node is a hash of its child nodes. This allows fast verification of large datasets and is widely used in blockchain, Git, and peer-to-peer networks.

## Apple Tree Analogy
Imagine a tree filled with apples 🍎:

Each apple has a unique taste – this represents a file/data block.

Instead of remembering the taste of every apple individually, the tree creates combinations (hashes) of these tastes.

These combinations are then combined again, until you reach one final unique taste at the top — the Merkle Root.

This Merkle Root summarizes the entire tree and can tell you if even one apple's taste has changed (i.e., data was tampered with).
